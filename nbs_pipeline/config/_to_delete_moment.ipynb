    "Multivariate time series are prevalent in real world applications such as finance, meteorology and healthcare. These time series often contain missing values due to various reasons, including equipment malfunctions and human errors. Missing values can impede the meaningful analyis of time series, and hence numerous studies have focused on the task of imputing these missing values using machine learning methodologies. In this tutorial, we will use MOMENT to address the issue of missing values. Formally, the imputation task can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: We are given a time series $T = [x_1, ..., x_L], \\ x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C}$ of length $L$ with $C$ channels (sensors or variables), and a boolean mask of same length $mask = [m_1, ..., m_L]$ indicating missing values. The objective of the imputation problem is to infer missing values and recover the original time series."

    "## 2. Loading MOMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first install the MOMENT package, load some essential packages and the pre-trained model. \n",
    "\n",
    "MOMENT can be loaded in 4 modes: (1) `reconstruction`, (2) `embedding`, (3) `forecasting`, and (4) `classification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `reconstruction` mode, MOMENT reconstructs input time series, potentially containing missing values. We can solve imputation and anomaly detection problems in this mode. This mode is suitable for solving imputation and anomaly detection tasks. During pre-training, MOMENT is trained to predict the missing values within uniformly randomly masked patches (disjoint sub-sequences) of the input time series, leveraging information from observed data in other patches. As a result, MOMENT comes equipped with a pre-trained reconstruction head, enabling it to address imputation and anomaly detection challenges in a zero-shot manner! Check out the `anomaly_detection.ipynb` notebook for more details!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `embedding` model, MOMENT learns a $d$-dimensional embedding (e.g., $d=1024$ for `MOMENT-1-large`) for each input time series. These embeddings can be used for clustering and classification. MOMENT can learn embeddings in a zero-shot setting! Check out `representation_learning.ipynb` and `classification.ipynb` notebooks for more details! \n",
    "\n",
    "The `forecasting` and `classification` modes are used for forecasting and classification tasks, respectively. In these modes, MOMENT learns representations which are subsequently mapped to the forecast horizon or the number of classes, using linear forecasting and classification heads. Both the forecasting and classification head are randomly initialized, and therefore must be fine-tuned before use. Check out the `forecasting.ipynb` and `classification.ipynb` notebooks for more details!"
